- I decided to split the system into 4 main service based on their responsibility
    - Location Service: Retrieve/Register new Location
    - Person Service: Retrieve/Register new Person
    - Connection Service: Retrieve connection between users (Combine data from Location Service and Person Service)
    - Location gRPC: Handle the large volume of location data that will be ingested
Message passing strategies
- For Person Service and Connection Service we can keep REST as communication strategies
- I assume that location data will be sent from user's device to our system in realtime with large volume
    - So, gRPC will be used to speed up/reduce the latency when sending data between user's device to system
    - Due to large volume of data, there maybe bottleneck, the service may freeze => data will be lost.
        - So message queue (Kafka) will be used to handle the problem. Location Service will recieve data from Kafka and persits them to db.
